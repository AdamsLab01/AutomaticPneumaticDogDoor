# AutomaticPneumaticDogDoor
 Automatic Pneumatic Dog Door

 This sketch was written to automate the opening of a dog door for my home lab. I used a pneumatic actuator to open the door, but the code is not specific to that you could use anything you can get connected to an ESP32. The sketch requires two external libraries - Espalexa and millisDelay, which I have included here but you should download the latest versions if available. 

For more information and to see the door in action see:
